## Hello! 👋

I'm a passionate developer and musician based in Nepal. I love building things with code and making music in my spare time.

### What I Do

By day, I work as a software developer, building web applications and solving interesting problems. By night (and weekends), I'm often found playing guitar or exploring new technologies.

### My Journey

I started programming when I was young, fascinated by the idea of creating something from nothing. That fascination has grown into a career that I truly love.

Music has been a parallel journey. Playing guitar helps me relax and brings a different kind of creativity into my life.

### Philosophy

I believe in:

- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Continuous learning
- Sharing knowledge with the community
- Building tools that make people's lives better

### This Site

This portfolio is my little corner of the internet where I share:

- Technical blog posts and tutorials
- Guitar tabs and lessons
- Project showcases
- Random thoughts and learnings

Feel free to explore and reach out if you want to connect!
